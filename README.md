# IPoAC
> Internet Protocol over Avian Carriers technical specification and implementation.

This project aims to show and use the technical advantages of a modified IPoAC protocol to revolutionize TCP/IP and UDP/IP communication across a variety of devices.

# Advantages of IPoAC
- can transport large amounts of data with little-to-zero data loss (3 terabyte for HEAD storage and up to 2.44 petabyte for BODY storage)
- high throughput (at least 6206 Gbps, up to and beyond 1 Tbps)
- zero computing overhead
- reliable P2P (peer-to-peer) structure
- environment-friendly, 0-carbon design

While IPoAC does introduce higher-than-usual latency and packet-loss, the specification can work reliably as it accounts for potentially corrupt data.

# Structure
Packet-structure consists of two parts, HEAD and BODY, where HEAD contains important metadata and can store up to 3 terabyte of data. The BODY can contain any amount of structured or unstructured data of up to 2.44 petabyte in size.
